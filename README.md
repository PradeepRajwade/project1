The code starts by importing the Tkinter library, which provides the necessary tools for creating GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications.
It then creates a main window for the calculator using the Tk() function from the Tkinter library and assigns it to the variable root.
The root.title() function sets the title of the calculator window to "Standard Calculator".
The root.resizable() function disables the resizing of the calculator window, making it non-resizable.
An entry field is created using the Entry() function from Tkinter. This entry field is used to display and input numbers and calculations. Several configuration options are provided for the entry field, such as width, background color, foreground color, border width, text alignment, and font. The entry field is then placed on the window using the grid() method, specifying the row, column, and other positioning parameters.
The code defines several functions that will be called when buttons are clicked:
The buttonClick() function is called when a number button is clicked. It retrieves the current input from the entry field, clears the field, and inserts the clicked number at the end.
The buttonClear() function is called when the clear button ('AC') is clicked. It simply clears the entry field by deleting its contents.
The buttonGet() function is called when an operator button ('+', '-', 'x', '/') is clicked. It stores the first number entered and the type of operation in global variables for later use in the buttonEqual() function. It also inserts the clicked operator into the entry field.
The buttonEqual() function is called when the equal button ('=') is clicked. It retrieves the current input from the entry field, extracts the second number and the operator, performs the corresponding calculation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), and inserts the result into the entry field.
After defining the functions, the code creates buttons for the numbers 0 to 9, decimal point ('.'), and the operators '+', '-', 'x', and '/'. Each button is created using the Button() function, providing the text to display, padding, and the function to call when clicked. The buttons are also configured with a specific font.
The buttons are placed on the calculator window using the grid() method, specifying their positions in rows and columns.
Finally, the code enters the main event loop using the mainloop() method. This loop listens for user interactions and keeps the calculator window open until the user closes it.
